    "1. Only submit a `README.md` file that identify you, this notebook file (`hw2.ipynb`) with your answers, and the html export of the notebook (`hw2.html`), along with all code (`*.jl`) that are necessary to reproduce the results. *No other files will not be graded.*\n",

    "2. Before the due date, commit your **master** branch. The teaching assistant and the instructor will check out your committed master branch for grading. Commit time will be used as your submission time. That means if you commit your Homework submission after the deadline, penalty points will be deducted for late submission according to the syllabus.\n",

That is, if $A=LU  \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$, the $U$ should overwrite the upper triangular part of the input matrix `A`, and the strictly lower triangular part of `A` should be overwritten by the same part of the $L$ matrix computed. (Where does the diagonal part of $L$ go?)\n",

    "    Tuple{Array{Int64,1},Int64}\n",

Use `tol` to determine the singularity.\n",

By setting the first element of $\\mathbf{u}_k$ to 1, you can fit in these vectors in $\\mathbf{X}$. The algorithm should return an additional vector storing the values of $\\mathbf{u}_k^T\\mathbf{u}_k$. This is how the LAPACK routine `geqrf` is designed.
